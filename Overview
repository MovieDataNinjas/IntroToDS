Causal analysis, understanding the effect or impact that reviews have on revenue.

Stated Factors
Movie Genre
Production company, 
Movie budget
IMDB user ratings
Studios - are more immune to critic reviews than others? 
Big-budget films & small-budget?

Approach
1. Build a non-linear, tree-based model (i.e., RF or GBDT) to predict Revenue based on all of the stated factors.
2. For each subgroup you want to analyze, predict E[Rev|Good Review, Subgroup] and E[Rev|Bad Review, Subgroup] 
3. Plot the above against each other for different subgroups. Those that are on the diagonal are those that are more immune to bad reviews.
